A few years ago I took the plunge and started using BreakTime.app, a small application designed to periodically force you to take a break from what you're doing on your PC. In an age of non-ergonomic Apple keyboards and eye-straining glossy displays, the importance of getting some brief respite from your hours slaving over a glowing screen can't be overstated.

Now, BreakTime is a great concept, but it has some major UX issues. I don't even want to try to guess the number of times it's pulled me out of the zone, but that's indeed what it's designed to do so I can't fault it too much for that. It's got some more concrete design problems that can't be so easily overlooked. The one that finally pushed me over the edge is how it unapologetically hides everything in the top right quadrant of the screen; exactly where I want to write commit messages.

This might seem like it would be a pretty rare event, but it happened all the time.

Over time, I eventually found a far less invasive solution. It makes me feel like a luddite, but it manages to keep itself out of my daily work routine while at the same time reminding me that it's time to take a few minutes of R&R.
