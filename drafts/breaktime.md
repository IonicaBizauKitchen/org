A few years ago I took the plunge and started using BreakTime.app. For those not familiar with it, BreakTime is a small application designed to periodically force you to take a break from what you're doing on your PC. It starts a timer (configurable, but starts at 20 minutes), and when that expires you're shown a full-screen modal that forces you to take a break for the duration of another timer (starts at 2 minutes). In an age of non-ergonomic Apple keyboards and eye-straining glossy displays, the importance of getting some brief respite from your hours slaving over a glowing screen can't be overstated, and my eyes thanked me when I started using it.

BreakTime is a great concept, but its propensity to obscure the top right quadrant of my screen while I was trying to type commit messages, finally drove me crazy enough to start looking for alternatives.

This might seem like it would be a pretty rare event, but it happened all the time.

BreakTime also doesn't care whether you're in the middle of a video call, handling a production incident, or deep in the zone. No matter what your current working situation, it will yank you out to its modal; the choppy transition animation symbolizing its typical callous enthusiasm.

Over time, I eventually found a far less invasive solution. It makes me feel like a luddite, but it manages to keep itself out of my daily work routine while at the same time reminding me that it's time to take a few minutes of R&R. As a bonus, I get a beautiful piece of industrial design to decorate my desk, and the warm knowledge that I'm living by the same technology that Magellan used to circumnavigate the globe.

For those interested, this is a very basic $16 [30 minute black sand hourglass](http://www.amazon.com/Hourglass-Sand-Timer-Minute-Black/dp/B004V4RTXW/) available via Amazon.
