I've owned two iPads in my life, the first generation iPad lovingly acquired on release day, and the more recently bought latest generation iPad Mini Retina. The first was an abysmal failure when added to my arsenal, and for a long time afterwards I championed the position that a tablet couldn't be a productive acquisition. Going against my own advice, I tried the iPad again, and this time I'd consider the purchase a huge success.

In order to avoid buyer's remorse, my personal standard is that I have to be still using a new device months after its purchase &mdash; the high experienced during the first week of ownership doesn't count. My more recent iPad as fulfilled these criteria where the first failed miserably. The difference isn't in the faster processor, smaller form factor, or more vibrant display, although all these features are certainly nice to have; rather it's in my preconceptions and approach to using the device.

I read books, triage e-mail, peruse RSS, watch movies, and even browse the web on it, but I never try to cross the boundary into any kind of media production. By strictly adhering to only one side of the line, all the iPad's usability problems actually start to flip around to look like advantages:
