I just shaved for an entire using a safety razor for the first time, and can say definitively that:

* As indicated most poignantly by [the Onion](http://www.theonion.com/articles/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades,11056/), modern shaving technology is a lot more about marketing than shaving.
* This is one of those dead simple lifehacks that every man should consider immediately.

I'd previously tried changing my shaving routine to use a straight razor, but as you might expect, found the process to be overly difficult, risky, and time consuming despite the abundance of cool equipment involved. This put me off trying the safety razor for a while, but when I did happily discovered that it was much closer on the practicality spectrum to a modern multi-bladed plastic razor than it was to the cool-but-impractical safety razor.

I watched a Youtube video on instruction, but in retrospect probably didn't need to. Using it is quite straightforward as long as care is taken to consider its particularly sharp blade. It's not something that I appreciate very often, but inspecting the safety razor's mechanism will reveal how clever of an invention it actually is. The careful placement of the razor blade within the metal frame makes it very difficult to attack your face at the wrong angle and cut yourself accidentally. It doesn't help with the prevention of the small cuts caused by a sharp razor used on sensitive skin, but doesn't produce more of them either.

The real wins of the safety razor though are the price and the resulting shaves. A stainless steel body will set you back as much as a single branded razor, but instead of a chunk of plastic with questionable durability, you get a beautifully designed item that you can keep for life. A 50 count box of a Japanese-made feathered razors will cost you a whopping $13, which means that instead of not replacing dull blades for fear of the bill, you'll replace your razors on schedule without giving it a second thought. The net effect: a better shave and a smoother face.

Bonus fact: it used to be common practice to have a razor blade disposal slot in walls and cabinets. The surprising piece is that there was no plan for disposal at all: the blades would more often than not just fall into the interior of the wall and accumulate there. Just like the national budget and production software written without tests, this was a raw manifestation of making a problem today a non-issue by punting the problem through time to be handled by a future generation.
